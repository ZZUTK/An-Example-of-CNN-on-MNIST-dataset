# An Example of CNN on MNIST dataset

Detailes of the CNN strucdure in the demo, as well as the mathematical derivation of 
backpropagation can be found in ["Derivation of Backpropagation in Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)"](), which is specifically written for this demo.  

The implementation of CNN uses the trimmed version of DeepLearnToolbox by [R. B. Palm](https://github.com/rasmusbergpalm/DeepLearnToolbox). 

## Pre-requisite

## Run demos

```
>> demo_CNN_MNIST
```

Note that only 1 epoch will be performs. If you want to run more epochs, please modify the variable `num_epochs ` in the file [`demo_CNN_MNIST.m`](https://github.com/ZZUTK/An-Example-of-CNN-on-MNIST-dataset-/blob/master/demo_CNN_MNIST.m) (line 62).
