# An Example of CNN on MNIST dataset

The implementation of CNN uses the trimmed version of DeepLearnToolbox by [R. B. Palm](https://github.com/rasmusbergpalm/DeepLearnToolbox). Detailes of the CNN strucdure in the demo, as well as the mathematical derivation of 
backpropagation can be found in ["Derivation of Backpropagation in Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)"](), which is specifically written for this demo.
